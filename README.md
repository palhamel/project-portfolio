# project-portfolio

Mission was to build a portfolio and follow the design guides. Using flexbox, making it fully responsive and also work with cross-browser and accessibility testing.


## The problem

Great project!
I followed JennieÂ´s words about working one section at a time. It was not att all easy to try to look like the design guides. Harder than I expected.
I have only used the text from the design guide, not my own text. This only to be able to get the project done in time. I think this is a living and ongoing project and I will keep on working with it.

I've done testing and also wrote my own process document for testing. However I will work more on accessibility, like getting the text to talk on iOS to work with the langue. 

I coded in VS Code, used Live Server to update and the Inspector in Chrome to view code and errors.
